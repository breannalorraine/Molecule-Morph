Breanna Wright (Lorraine)- Fall 2015 

LSD Molecule Morph is an Openframeworks extension of my final Major Studio Project utilizing ofxMSAOpenCL, ofxMSAPingPong addons and ofEasyCam. This Openframeworks project is the morphing of a polygonal figure into the molecule for LSD, there is also the same for the molecule of the substances ketamine, MDMA and cannbis. These are all the substances used by an artist I interviwed for my Major Studio Project.

MY PROCESS: 

So I started researching how I could find an OF example of how to morph one object into another and thought I would need a GUI addon to have controls. OfGUI wasnâ€™t necessary but the tutorial I found on Pinterest utilized two different addons and a function in OF called ofEasyCam. I started off coding how the particles would be created and then set up the controls of the direction they would go in. Then the set up of ofEasyCam was coded to control how the polygon rotates and what angle it is being seen at. Finally I finished the tutorial with setting up the cube to morph into the final image I wanted to portray which is a vector image of the LSD molecule I created in Illustrator. I had a couple of missteps following along but eventually it worked. 


Control keys: 1 - morph to cube, 2 - morph to drug molecule.

Reflective Questions Answered:


After Effects Platform versus Openframeworks?

Within creating a more interactive segment for my Major Studio Final I wanted to have this OF project become an extension of my motion graphics video. Both of these projects would be placed on a platform called Rapt Media which serves as a video controls platform to select which segment within a video you want to see or jump to. I would give the option of choosing to see and learn about the drugs mentioned in the video and then the OF project would pop up where you would use the controls to see the cube morph into the drug molecule with a short description about what the drug is and does. 


How does this change the narrative?

Now that there are controls within the animation, it is giving the user autonomy to learn more about the drugs mentioned rather than just hearing it while watching the video and being confused. The ability to control how the molecule takes shape will also create more engagement with the user and they will retain the info about the drug more memorably.
